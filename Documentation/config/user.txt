user.name::
user.email::
author.name::
author.email::
committer.name::
committer.email::
	The `user.name` and `user.email` variables determine what ends
	up in the `author` and `committer` field of commit
	objects.
	If you need the `author` or `committer` to be different, the
	`author.name`, `author.email`, `committer.name` or
	`committer.email` variables can be set.
	Also, all of these can be overridden by the `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`,
	`GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`,
	`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` and `EMAIL` environment variables.
+
Note that the `name` forms of these variables conventionally refer to
some form of a personal name.  See linkgit:git-commit[1] and the
environment variables section of linkgit:git[1] for more information on
these settings and the `credential.username` option if you're looking
for authentication credentials instead.

user.useConfigOnly::
	Instruct Git to avoid trying to guess defaults for `user.email`
	and `user.name`, and instead retrieve the values only from the
	configuration. For example, if you have multiple email addresses
	and would like to use a different one for each repository, then
	with this configuration option set to `true` in the global config
	along with a name, Git will prompt you to set up an email before
	making new commits in a newly cloned repository.
	Defaults to `false`.

user.signingKey::
	Deprecated alias for `signing.<signing.default>.signingIdentity`. If
	neither `signing.default` or the deprecated alias `gpg.format` are
	set, the default value of "openpgp" for `signing.default` is assumed
	and the value of `signing.openpgp.signingIdentity` is used.
