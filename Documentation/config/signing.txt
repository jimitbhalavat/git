signing.default::
	The default signing format to use when signing commits and tags.
	The value must be one of: "openpgp" or "x509".
	The default value is "openpgp".
+
The default executable to run for "openpgp" is "`gpg`", for "x509" is
"`gpgsm`".

signing.openpgp.program::
	Use this custom program instead of "`gpg`" found on `$PATH` when
	making or verifying an OpenPGP signature. The program must support
	the same command-line interface as GPG, namely, to verify a detached
	signature, "`gpg --verify $file - <$signature`" is run, and the
	program is expected to signal a good signature by exiting with
	code 0, and to generate an ASCII-armored detached signature, the
	standard input of "`gpg -bsau $key`" is fed with the contents to be
	signed, and the program is expected to send the result to its
	standard output.

signing.openpgp.signingIdentity::
	If linkgit:git-tag[1] or linkgit:git-commit[1] is not selecting
	automatically the identity you want when creating a signed tag or
	commit, you may override the default selection with this variable.
	This option is passed unchanged as the `--local-user` parameter, so
	you may specify a key using any method that "`gpg`" supports.

signing.openpgp.keyring::
	Use this to specify the path to a custom keyring of public keys to
	use when verifying signatures made with OpenPGP. This option is
	passed unchanged as the `--keyring` parameter to "`gpg`".

signing.openpgp.noDefaultKeyring::
	When `signing.openpgp.keyring` is set, this boolean, when set to
	true, causes the `--no-default-keyring` option to be passed to
	"`gpg`". When set to false, the keyring specified by
	`signing.openpgp.keyring` will be used in addition to the default
	public keyring.

signing.openpgp.minTrustLevel::
	Specifies a minimum trust level for signature verification.  If
	this option is unset, then signature verification for merge
	operations require a key with at least `marginal` trust.  Other
	operations that perform signature verification require a key
	with at least `undefined` trust.  Setting this option overrides
	the required trust-level for all operations.  Supported values,
	in increasing order of significance:
+
* `undefined`
* `never`
* `marginal`
* `fully`
* `ultimate`

signing.x509.program::
	Use this custom program instead of "`gpgsm`" found on `$PATH` when
	making or verifying an x.509 signature.

signing.x509.signingIdentity::
	If linkgit:git-tag[1] or linkgit:git-commit[1] is not selecting
	automatically the identity you want when creating a signed tag or
	commit, you may override the default selection with this variable.
	This option is passed unchanged as the `--local-user` parameter, so
	you may specify a key using any method that "`gpgsm`" supports.
